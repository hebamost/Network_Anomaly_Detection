# Network_Anomaly_Detection
 
The exponential growth of network traffic has led to an increase in network
anomalies, such as cyber attacks, network failures, and hardware malfunctions.
Network anomaly detection is a critical task for maintaining the security and
stability of computer networks. The objective is to how K-Means and Normalized Cut algorithms can be used
for network anomaly detection.
